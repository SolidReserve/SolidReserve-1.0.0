   solidreserve-cli setgenerate true <number_of_threads>
   ```
   - Replace `<number_of_threads>` with the number of CPU threads you want to allocate (e.g., `4`).

2. **Stop Mining**:
   ```bash
   solidreserve-cli setgenerate false
   ```

3. **Check Mining Status**:
   ```bash
   solidreserve-cli getmininginfo

   Displays:
   - Current hash rate.
   - Network difficulty.
   - Number of mined blocks.

4. **Check Wallet Balance**:
   ```bash
   solidreserve-cli getbalance
   ```

5. **Estimate Mining Rewards**:
   ```bash
